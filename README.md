# Bayesian Structure learning using DAGMA in cases where you have some prior knowledge about the existence of some edges and their proportional power in the Graph
```math
  Here the Hadamard product of the inverse of each component in the prior knowledge Matrix $$ B $$ ($$ B^* $$) and adjacency matrix $ |W| $ is replaced with the original sparsity term in DAGMA(https://github.com/kevinsbello/dagma#readme)
